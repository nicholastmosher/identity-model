- Create an event log for the purpose of delivering a security report
  at the beginning of each day. The app would deliver one notification
  each day, and it should be a summary of all peers that have participated
  in a backup of your peer's designated replicate-me data. The app presents
  a view that's a timeline of confirmed synchronization events with your
  trusted replication circle. This gives you a daily feed of confirming
  backups have been completed successfully. The objective would be to
  get people in the habit of being backup-conscious, because a genuine
  alternative to cloud software means that we'll need to set new
  expectations around digital security and data protection. I believe
  many people use cloud backup services because there's no better way yet
  to protect their data with such ease and confidence.

- Replicate-me data would be like albums or other directories of data that
  you ask trusted peers to keep a copy of for you. With a given peer, exchange
  an agreed upon amount of disk space to dedicate to storing that peer's data,
  their replicate-me data.
